<h2>Yo, I'm Pablo</h2>

Also known as Pado, I'm a programmer and I love coding be it in personal projects or work projects. I'm a self-taught programmer, I believe anyone can learn anything with hard work
My favorite programming language's python and it's also the first programming language that I learned.
So I have a lot of practice with it, my second favorite language is C# because I've been using it with ASP.NET for work for about two years now.

I'm 19 years old and I started programming about four years ago. but when I started I didn't publish all of my projects on github, so I started adding them 2 years ago when
I find a new one or start a new one.
In my repositories you will find my personal projects, some of them I haven't changed the code since I did them, I may have optimized some of them, but I always add
something here and there.
